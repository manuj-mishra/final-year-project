 We use evolutionary algorithms to reverse-engineer cellular automata (CA). From observations of CA execution, we deduce transition functions for the goals of imitation learning and procedural generation. We tackle two classes of CA: Life-Like CA and Gray-Scott systems. The former is the family in which John Conway's infamous "Game of Life" CA belongs and the latter is a discretization of Turing's chemical model for morphogenesis.\\
