I would like to thank my supervisor, Prof. Andrew Davison, who has supported me in every direction I have taken this thesis. Your continued enthusiasm has given this project \textit{life}.\\

\noindent
I would like to thank my friends, who have made the last 3 years a joy and inspire me in ways they cannot imagine. Your presence gives \textit{life} its colour.\\

\noindent
Finally, I would like to thank my family, who have always been my anchor and my compass. Without you, \textit{life} would be impossible.
